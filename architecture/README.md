# Architecture Layer 1 (A.N.T. System)

This directory contains the **Architectural Layer** of the StarSeed Network. It defines the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Specifications, and Fundamentals that govern the system's logic.

## Structure

### `specifications/`
Formal specifications for APIs, Data Formats, and Protocols.
- **Goal**: Define the "Contract" between components.

### `formats/`
JSON Schemas, Object Templates, and standardized file structures.
- **Goal**: Ensure data consistency across the network.

### `modalities/`
Definitions of Interaction Models (e.g., Spatial/Zero UI, Voice, Text).
- **Goal**: Document how users interact with the system.

### `fundamentals/`
Core philosophies and invariant rules (Ontocracy, Cyberdelic Design).
- **Goal**: Align technology with the project's vision.

## The Golden Rule
> If logic changes, update the SOP in this architecture folder BEFORE updating the code.
