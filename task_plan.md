# Task Plan (task_plan.md)

This file tracks the phases, goals, and checklists for the StarSeed Network development under the B.L.A.S.T. protocol.

## Phase 0: Initialization
- [x] Create Project Memory files (`gemini.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`, `task_plan.md`)
- [x] Complete Discovery Questions in `gemini.md`

## Phase 1: Blueprint (Vision & Logic)
- [x] Define Data Schema in `gemini.md` (Confirmed & Implemented)
- [ ] Research existing codebase and resources

## Phase 2: Link (Connectivity)
- [x] Verify API status (Supabase Verified: `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`)
- [x] Create simple handshake scripts (`tools/verify_db.py`)


## Phase 3: Architect (A.N.T. 3-Layer Build)
- [ ] Develop Core Logic (Neural Layer)
- [/] Develop Interface/API (Tangible Layer)
    - [x] Implement Advanced Appearance System (Layout, Styling, Typography, Backgrounds)
    - [x] Verify Visual Aesthetics and Functionality
    - [x] Establish System Architecture & Documentation Structure
    - [/] Implement Control Panel & AI Integration (Whiteboard/Boards)
    - [ ] Implement Trinity Interface (Perimeter Activation System)
        - [ ] Zenith (Top/Blue): AI Contextual Guide Agent
        - [ ] Anchor (Bottom/Red/White): Main Trinity Dock
        - [ ] Horizon (Left/Green): Creation Canvas Agent
        - [ ] Logic (Right/Yellow): System Control Agent
    - [ ] Implement "Zero UI" Interaction Logic (Hover/Peek/Spring Physics)
- [ ] Abstraction & Optimization (Abstract Layer)
