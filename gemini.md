# 🌌 Project Constitution (gemini.md)

This document is the single source of truth for the **StarSeed Network** project. It defines the Data Schemas, Behavioral Rules, and Architectural Invariants.

## 1. Discovery (Pending Input)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following sections must be defined before any coding begins.

- **North Star**: [TODO: What is the singular desired outcome?]
- **Integrations**: [TODO: External services, APIs, Auth, etc.]
- **Source of Truth**: [TODO: Where does primary data live?]
- **Delivery Payload**: [TODO: How/where is final result delivered?]
- **Behavioral Rules**: [TODO: Tone, logic constraints, "Do Not" rules]

## 2. Data Schema

*To be defined after Discovery.*

```json
// Pending Schema Definition
```

## 3. Architectural Invariants

- **Protocol**: B.L.A.S.T. (Blueprint, Link, Architect, Stylize, Trigger)
- **Architecture**: A.N.T. 3-Layer System (Abstract, Neural, Tangible)
- **Priorities**: Reliability > Speed. No guessing.
