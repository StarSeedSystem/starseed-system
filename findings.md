# Findings Log (findings.md)

This file logs research, discoveries, and constraints encountered during development.

## Research
- [2026-01-26]: Analyzed `🚀 B.L.A.S.T. Master System Prompt.docx`. Identified core requirements for protocol adoption.
- [2026-01-26]: Discovered `Prompt Maestro Definitivo`. Extracted detailed requirements for "StarSeed Network" including North Star, Integrations, and Data Schema (Atomic Posts, Realtime Sync).
